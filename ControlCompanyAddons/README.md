# ControlCompany Additions Mod

This mod adds some additional features to the famous ControlCompany mod!<br>

This includes things ControlCompany will never add, or isn't available, yet!<br>

So... What does this mod actually do?<br>
Right now it only adds the ability to control the hoarding bug's attack mode.<br>
(Please note that at least one player needs to have at least one item in their inventory for the attack to start)<br>

More will come in the future!<br>
