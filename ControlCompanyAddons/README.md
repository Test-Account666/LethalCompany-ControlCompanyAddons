# ControlCompany Additions Mod

This mod adds some additional features to the famous ControlCompany mod!

This includes things ControlCompany will never add, or isn't available, yet!

So... What does this mod actually do?<br>
Right now it only adds the ability to control the hoarding bug's attack mode.<br>
(Please note that at least one player needs to have at least one item in their inventory for the attack to start)

More will come in  the future!
