# ControlCompany Additions Mod

This mod adds some additional features to the famous ControlCompany mod!<br>

This includes things ControlCompany will never add, or isn't available, yet!<br>

So... What does this mod actually do?<br>

- Adds the ability to control a hoarding bug's attack mode<br>
  (Please note that at least one player needs to have at least one item in their inventory for the attack to start)<br>
- Adds the ability to control lunging and inspecting as an eyeless dog<br>
- Adds the ability to release the control of an enemy instead of deleting it<br>
- Adds an ESP key to allow you seeing players through walls<br>

More will come in the future!<br>
